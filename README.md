# Cognitive-Driven Development (CDD)

Cognitive-Driven Development (CDD) is a coding design technique that aims to reduce the effort that developers place in understanding a given piece of code, for instance, a class. 

The ideia behind CDD is that one needs to limit the number of code constructs, but this limit should be defined in a disciplined way. 

To know more about CDD, read [here](https://www.zup.com.br/blog/cognitive-driven-development-cdd) (in pt-br).

## Plugin

> **Warning**
>
> _This plugin is still under development, and should be used with care._

This implementation is built using [spoon](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon), a static analysis tool for Java programs. Currently the compliance version is set to Java 17.


## Instalation 

There are two ways to use this plugin: standalone or through StackSpot.

### Running through CLI

To use the latest version, clone this project and create a `jar` file. Then run the `jar` pointing to the project to be analyzed. For instance:

```
git clone git@github.com:gustavopintozup/poc-plugin-cdd.git

cd poc-plugin-cdd

mvn clean compile assembly:single

java -jar target/cdd-<versao-atual>-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -p <diretÃ³rio-do-projeto-que-quero-analisar>
```
